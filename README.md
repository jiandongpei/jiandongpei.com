# jiandongpei.com — Canonical Boundary Index

This repository hosts the **canonical site** for Jiandong Pei’s work on
SAP BTP extension failures and the Boundary Model.

The site serves three purposes:

1. Canonical definition of the **Boundary Model**
2. Stable index of **published architectural analyses**
3. Reference point for **independent architecture verdict engagements**

This is not a blog mirror or marketing site.
LinkedIn remains the primary distribution channel; this site provides
**canonical attribution and long-term recall**.
