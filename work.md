# Work

My work is **contract-bound architecture judgment**.

I join when a program is no longer blocked by missing knowledge,
but by **missing authority to decide**.

This is not delivery.
This is not implementation rescue.
It is an external verdict that restores boundary jurisdiction
and survives post go-live reality.

---

## Engagement options  
*(fixed pricing · scope-bound · verdict-driven)*

### Option A — Boundary Verdict Sprint (USD 9.5k)

A short, high-signal verdict when the system already *runs*,
but nobody can agree on what is actually safe.

**Scope**
- Runtime / Execution boundary  
- Identity boundary  
- Tenant boundary  
- Data boundary  
- Integration boundary  
- Lifecycle boundary  

**Deliverables**
- Boundary map across the full extension landscape
- Non-negotiable decision points  
  *(what must change vs what must not change)*
- Written verdict memo (architecture-level, not tickets)

---

### Option B — Boundary Audit (USD 35k)

For programs where multiple teams own fragments of the truth,
and local fixes have started to contradict each other.

**Includes everything in Option A, plus**
- Interview-based ownership & jurisdiction map
- Cross-boundary conflict analysis
- Remediation direction with **jurisdiction rules**  
  *(not a task list, not a redesign)*

The output is a shared decision frame
that prevents re-litigation after go-live.

---

### Option C — Annual Boundary Coverage (USD 95k)

For organizations running multiple BTP extensions in parallel
and needing repeated architectural verdicts over time.

This option establishes an **ongoing external judgment authority**
across design reviews, rollout phases, and post go-live incidents.

---

## Negotiation policy

Rates are not discounted.

If budget is constrained,
we adjust **scope and timebox**, not price.

---

## How to engage

Send one message with:

1) your landscape  
   *(S/4 + BTP runtime + identity stack)*  
2) symptoms  
   *(what works where, what breaks where)*  
3) timeline  
   *(go-live / rollout stage)*  
4) ownership reality  
   *(who actually decides today)*  
5) the decision you cannot get to
