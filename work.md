# Work

I provide **contract-bound architecture judgment** — not implementation.

Teams bring me in when they need an external verdict to stop endless investigations, restore clear ownership, and make a decision that survives **post go-live reality**.

## What I do (and what I don’t)

**I do**
- Diagnose boundary failures in SAP BTP extension landscapes.
- Produce a written verdict that clarifies **what must change** vs **what must not change**.
- Define jurisdiction rules (who owns what, where the platform ends, where the extension begins).
- Help leadership converge when “everyone has a piece of the truth”.

**I don’t**
- Provide delivery/implementation services.
- Join as staff augmentation, ticket execution, or “extra hands”.
- Replace your architects — I align them around a stable decision.

## The boundary map I use

My work is grounded in six boundaries:

1. **Runtime Boundary** — what runs where, and what runtime rules actually govern behavior  
2. **Identity Boundary** — identity propagation, trust, and authorization context across layers  
3. **Tenant Boundary** — tenant routing, isolation expectations, and multitenancy truth vs assumptions  
4. **Data Boundary** — ownership, integrity rules, replication, and cross-domain data contracts  
5. **Integration Boundary** — cross-system jurisdiction (“Postman works, Work Zone fails”)  
6. **Lifecycle Boundary** — upgrades, rollout rules, evolution authority, and long-term stability window  

This applies to CAP and beyond (e.g., RAP-based scenarios, Kyma/CF workloads, Work Zone surfaces) — the failure pattern is architectural, not framework-specific.

## When architectural judgment is required

You are likely facing a boundary failure if:

- It works in one tenant but fails in another.
- It works in Postman but breaks behind AppRouter / Work Zone.
- It “passed go-live” but degrades months later during rollout, scale, or organizational change.
- Fixes require changing subdomains, destinations, trust, roles, or tenant routing (not just code).
- Multiple teams are involved, yet no one clearly owns the failure.

## Engagement formats (fixed-fee, scope-based)

I keep engagements **fixed-fee and timeboxed**. Pricing is shared in a short SOW after an intake message.

### Option A — Boundary Verdict Sprint
For high-signal situations where the program is already in “it’s complicated” mode.

**Outputs**
- Boundary map (all six boundaries)
- Top decision points: what must change vs what must not change
- Written verdict memo (shareable inside leadership)

### Option B — Boundary Audit
For deeper diagnosis + stakeholder alignment when ownership is fragmented across teams/vendors.

**Outputs**
- Everything in Option A, plus:
- Interview-based ownership map (who controls what in reality)
- Remediation plan framed as **jurisdiction rules**, not a ticket list
- Convergence notes: the minimum set of decisions required to end the investigation loop

### Option C — Annual Coverage
For organizations running multiple extensions and needing repeated verdicts across the year.

**Outputs**
- Multiple verdict cycles with consistent boundary language
- Ongoing boundary governance support (especially during rollout/upgrade windows)
- Priority access when incidents trigger a “responsibility gap”

## How to engage

Send one message with:

1) Your landscape (S/4 + BTP runtime(s) + identity)  
2) Symptoms (what works where, what breaks where)  
3) Timeline (go-live / rollout / recent change)  
4) Stakeholders (who owns what today)  
5) The decision you cannot converge on
