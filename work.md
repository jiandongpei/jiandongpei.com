# Work

My work is **contract-bound architectural judgment**.

I join when a program needs an external verdict:
to stop infinite investigations, restore coherent boundary ownership, and make a decision that survives **post go-live reality**.

## Engagement options (fixed fee, scope-bound)

### Option A — Boundary Verdict Sprint (USD 9.5k)

A short, high-signal verdict when the program is already in “it’s complicated” mode.

**Deliverables**
- Boundary map (**runtime/execution / identity / tenant / data / integration / lifecycle**)
- Top decision points (what must change vs what must not change)
- Written verdict memo

### Option B — Boundary Audit (USD 35k)

Deeper diagnosis + stakeholder alignment when multiple teams own fragments of the truth.

**Deliverables**
- Everything in Option A, plus:
- Interview-based ownership map
- Remediation plan with jurisdiction rules (not a ticket list)

### Option C — Annual Coverage (USD 95k)

For organizations running multiple extensions and needing repeated verdicts across the year.

## Fees & scope

Fees are fixed. If budget is constrained, we change **scope/timebox**, not the rate.

## How to engage

Send one message with:
1) your landscape (S/4 + BTP runtime + identity),  
2) symptoms (what “works” where / what breaks where),  
3) timeline (go-live / rollout),  
4) ownership today (who owns what),  
5) the decision you can’t get to.
