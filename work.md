# Work

My work is **contract‑bound architecture judgment**.

I join when the team needs an external verdict:
- to stop infinite investigations,
- to put ownership back into a coherent boundary structure,
- and to make a decision that survives post go‑live reality.

## Engagement options (fixed pricing, scope‑based)

### Option A — Boundary Verdict Sprint (USD 9.5k)
A short, high‑signal verdict when the program is already in “it’s complicated” mode.

**Deliverables**
- Boundary map (identity / tenant / data / lifecycle / integration)
- Top decision points (what must change vs what must not change)
- Written verdict memo

### Option B — Boundary Audit (USD 35k)
Deeper diagnosis + stakeholder alignment when multiple teams own fragments of the truth.

**Deliverables**
- Everything in Option A, plus:
- Interview‑based ownership map
- Remediation plan with *jurisdiction rules* (not a ticket list)

### Option C — Annual Coverage (USD 95k)
For organizations running multiple extensions and needing repeated verdicts across the year.

## Negotiation policy (simple)

I don’t discount the rate.  
If budget is constrained, we change **scope and timebox**, not price.

## How to engage

Send one message with:
1) your landscape (S/4 + BTP runtime + identity),
2) symptoms (what “works” where, what breaks where),
3) timeline (go‑live / rollout),
4) who owns what today,
5) the decision you can’t get to.
