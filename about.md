# About

I spent years building and unblocking SAP BTP internals and cross‑product integration — the kind of work teams get stuck on when “documentation looks correct” but the platform still breaks.

That builder‑side exposure is what shaped the **Boundary Model**:  
not a theory of tools, but a theory of **jurisdiction, ownership, and lifecycle** in real BTP programs.

## What I do (and do not do)

- ✅ **Architecture judgment / verdict** for boundary failures  
- ✅ Boundary model mapping: identity / tenant / data / lifecycle / integration / execution  
- ✅ Decision support for CIO/CTO‑level risk and scope control

- ❌ Implementation delivery / coding as a service  
- ❌ “Just join the team and fix tickets”

## Where to start
