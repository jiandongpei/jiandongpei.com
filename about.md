# About

I spent years building and unblocking SAP BTP internals and cross-product integrations —  
the kind of work teams get stuck on when *documentation looks correct*, yet the platform still breaks in reality.

That builder-side exposure is what shaped the **Boundary Model**.

Not a theory of tools.  
But a theory of **jurisdiction, ownership, and lifecycle** in real SAP BTP programs.

Most extension failures are not technical mistakes.  
They happen when architectural responsibility drifts — silently — after go-live.

My work exists in that gap.

## What I do (and what I do not)

**I do:**

- Provide **architectural judgment / independent verdicts** for SAP BTP boundary failures  
- Diagnose extension failures across identity, tenant, data, integration, execution, and lifecycle boundaries  
- Clarify **what must change** and **what must not change** for a system to remain stable over time  
- Support CIO / CTO-level decision-making where risk, ownership, and scope are unclear  

**I do not:**

- Deliver implementation or coding services  
- Join teams as staff augmentation  
- “Fix tickets” without resolving architectural responsibility  

My role is not to execute decisions —  
it is to make **the correct decision unavoidable**.
